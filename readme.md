This is a repository with work on an open-source collection of edited cases (many very lightly edited indeed) for a 14th Amendment course to be taught in Fall 2019.  This was originally created on the H2O platform at [https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/148049-14th-amendment-course](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/148049-14th-amendment-course), but with substantial editing from there (it turns out that the H2O platform exports have terrible formatting), as well as additional cases drawn from other sources---so that web link is totally obsolete.

Official version is the PDF and in working-copy.md in here.  Docx may have different pagination.  Reading schedule for the course I plan to teach this fall (while visiting at Boston University), qua sample syllabus, is also in here in case anyone wants to crib it.  That schedule assumes two review sessions and some flexible time toward the end of the course for catchup and synthesis. 

Build with makefile command `make build` . Requires pandoc and latex (texlive/mactex installation).

the subfolders with individual cases and automated scripts are intermediate products only, and may be inaccurate/incomplete.
