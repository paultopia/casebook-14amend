This is a repository with work on an open-source collection of edited cases (many very lightly edited indeed) for a 14th Amendment course to be taught in Fall 2019.  This was originally created on the H2O platform at [https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/148049-14th-amendment-course](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/148049-14th-amendment-course), but with substantial editing from there (it turns out that the H2O platform exports have terrible formatting). 

now builds with `pandoc -s -o testbuild.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex working-copy.md`
